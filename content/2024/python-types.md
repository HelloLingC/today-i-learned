# Collection Data Types

get length: len(dict)

## List

```python
list = [10, 20, 30]
```
Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
1. ordered
2. changeable
3. allow duplicate values

## Tuple

## Set

## Dictionary

```python
dict = {
    "a": "abc",
    "year": 1986
}
```

1. not allow duplicate values - Dictionaries cannot have two items with the same key.
2. changeable
3. unordered in old version, ordered in new version
